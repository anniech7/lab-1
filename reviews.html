      <li>Annie is amazing at what she does! I have never seen a photo of
        hers that I’m not obsessed with. I personally worked with Annie on
        a shoot. It was so fun, and went so smoothly. She makes you feel
        comfortable in front of the camera which allows her to capture the best
        photo. The quality of her photos surpasses the quality of other
        photographers I follow. Annie is dedicated to her clients and
        ensures they are given the best services. I’d recommend her any day
        of the week!</li>
      <li>Of all the professional photos I have had done in my life, the best
        experience, BY FAR, has been with Annie!</li>
      <li>Her style is fully modern with a sentimental touch, documenting the
        genuine emotion of the moment so you can revisit it for years to come.</li>
      <li>From the moment we first met Annie, it was as though we'd known her for years.</li>
